# bank
Kotlin project
In this project, I have made a class named Account with which you can fill the owner and balance related info and then there are the 
functions like getAccountDetails, depositAmount and withdrawAmount with which you can do the basic banking.
Will be adding more functions and methods to make it more advanced.
Keep Learning, keep growing!!
